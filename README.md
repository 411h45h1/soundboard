# SoundBoard App

This repository contains a SoundBoard app built using React Native and Expo. Users can create multiple soundboards, add sounds, and manage their playback. The app supports Android, iOS, and web platforms.

## Features

- Create, rename, and delete soundboards.
- Add and remove sounds from boards.
- Play and stop sounds.
- Sounds persist across app updates and restarts.

## Sound Persistence

The app ensures that sounds persist across app updates by:

1. Storing sounds in the app's dedicated sound directory
2. Maintaining metadata of all sounds in AsyncStorage
3. Validating sound files on app startup and fixing broken references

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or later)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1.x or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
